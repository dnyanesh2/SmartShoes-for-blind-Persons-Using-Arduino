# SmartShoes-for-blind-Persons-Using-Arduino
This paper presents an idea about dealing the problems faced by visually impaired individuals through assistive device in form of shoes. According to the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) survey in 2014 there is estimated 285 millions of people are visually impairment in which 37 millions of people are BLIND across the Globe over 15 millions of people are from INDIA. Where INDIA contributes to 21% of total blind population that’s why most of the blind people dependent on other people for their activities. Hence, we are introducing a assistive shoe for blind people which will help them in their needed activities. The shoes will detect the nearby objects or obstacles and simultaneously send a message to the receiver in audio/vibration form. So it helps the visually impaired person to acquire the extra knowledge about the obstacles around them without any help or any guidance. It will make them more independent because there should be an “EYE” for an “I”.
